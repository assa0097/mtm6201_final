# mtm6201_final
Final Assignment

--------------
Overview
Plant Palette is a responsive, accessible website concept for a vegetarian restaurant that values sustainability, health, and inclusivity. The site includes a welcoming homepage, an informative About page outlining the restaurantâ€™s mission and values, and a Contact page that makes it easy for visitors to get in touch or connect through social media.

---------------
Development Process
The project began with creating high-fidelity wireframes that reflected both aesthetic goals and user experience principles. These wireframes guided the layout and content structure of each page.

I set up a new GitHub repository named mtm6201_final and structured the project folders using lowercase and hyphenated naming conventions as per the assignment requirements. Bootstrap was used as the primary CSS framework for layout and responsiveness, while additional styling and customization were done with custom CSS.

Once development was complete, the website was published using GitHub.

Challenges Faced & Solutions
Responsive Image Handling: Initially, I found it tricky to manage image sizes across devices. I solved this by learning how to use the <picture> tag with srcset and media attributes to serve the right image at the right time.

Time Management: With other projects going on, balancing everything was tough. I created a mini roadmap for myself to tackle the project in chunks, which helped me stay focused and on track.
